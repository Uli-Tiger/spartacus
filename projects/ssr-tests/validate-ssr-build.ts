/**
 * Verify that the SSR app under tests meets the following criteria:
 * 1. The app us built in prod mode.
 *
 *    Why it's needed:
 *      Some tests require parsing single-line JSON log entries appearing in the SSR logs.
 *      In an app built in prod mode, the JSON objects are printed single-line that can be easily parsed in tests.
 *      In an app built in dev mode, the JSON objects are printed multi-line (to be more human-readable),
 *      but cannot be parsed in tests so it makes some tests to fail.
 *
 * 2. The app has configured a base OCC url being a local backend proxy, instead of a real backend.
 *
 *    Why it's needed:
 *      Some tests require mocking the behavior of the backend using a local backend http proxy.
 *      If the app is not calling a local backend proxy as a base OCC url, some tests will fail.
 *
 *
 * In this file we'll validate the build of the app before running the tests.
