# Estimated Delivery Date

Estimated Delivery Date allows customers to view an estimated delivery date by which the item would be delivered. The estimated date would be fetched from the backend system and displayed in mini cart, cart, order-review, order-confirmation and order-details pages.

It can be added to the existing Spartacus application by running `ng add @spartacus/estimated-delivery-date`. For more information about Spartacus schematics, visit the [official Spartacus schematics documentation page.](https://sap.github.io/spartacus-docs/schematics/)
