# Spartacus S/4HANA Service Integration Integration

SAP S/4HANA Service Integration library enables the replication of service products from SAP S/4HANA Service to SAP Commerce Cloud. It also enables the replication of service orders from SAP Commerce Cloud to SAP S/4HANA Service.

It can be added to the existing Spartacus application by running `ng add @spartacus/s4-service`. For more information about Spartacus schematics, visit the [official Spartacus schematics documentation page](https://sap.github.io/spartacus-docs/schematics/).
