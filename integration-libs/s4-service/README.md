# Spartacus S/4HANA Service Integration Integration

Spartacus' S/4HANA Service Integration library integrates SAP Commerce Cloud with SAP S/4HANA Service, enabling the replication of service products from SAP S/4HANA Service to SAP Commerce Cloud, and service orders from SAP Commerce Cloud to SAP S/4HANA Service.

It can be added to the existing Spartacus application by running `ng add @spartacus/s4-service`. For more information about Spartacus schematics, visit the [official Spartacus schematics documentation page](https://sap.github.io/spartacus-docs/schematics/).
