# Cpq-Quote
This library provides a discount percentage to the Spartacus UI.

As an end user utilizing the SAP Commerce B2B Storefront, it's imperative for transparency and informed decision-making that users can easily access and comprehend the discount percentage displayed on the Quote Table.

It can be added to the existing Spartacus application by running `ng add @spartacus/cpq-quote`. For more information about Spartacus schematics, visit the [official Spartacus schematics documentation page.](https://sap.github.io/spartacus-docs/schematics/)
